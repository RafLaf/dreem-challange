### IIR Butterworth band-pass filters 

The input EEG signal is filtered to eliminate undesired background signals and is decomposed 
into five frequency bands, namely δ, θ, α, β and γ, using five efficient Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth band-pass filters. The signals were segmented in 10 s epochs. IIR filters have simple transfer functions which can be easily realized on digital signal processers, digital hardware engines, and/or embedded systems. The frequency response of Butterworth filters has no ripple in the passband and is extremely flat. The minimum order of the filter is applied to yield a precise and significantly
